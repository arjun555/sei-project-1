GA SEI-19 Project 1 - Tic Tac Toe Game

# Brief
Create a rendition of the class game - tic tac toe

# Planning
What the game needs:
    - 2 Players  
    - Playing area (board)  
    - Pieces to play with (X's and O's)  
    - Score keeping  

# How is the winner computed?
Within the JS is an array to represent the game board. When the player clicks on a cell, the array is updated to an 'x' or 'o' (based on the user's designation). At the completion of a players turn, the JS counts how many pieces are in the rows, columns and diagonals. If the count is the size of the board, then the user is declared the winner. If the board is full and there is no winner, then the game is determined to be a draw.

# Challenges
CSS - Getting the DIV's where I wanted them on resize. Knowning the display stying is only applied to the children and not the grandchildren  
CSS - Vertically aligning text within a div

# Cool Tech
Theme - Game of Thrones  
CSS - Snows in the background  
CSS - Overlay on game result. Shows a gif  
JS - Keeping count of rows/columns/diagonals will be helpful when making CPU player logic
